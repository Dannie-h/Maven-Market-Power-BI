"# Maven-market-Power-BI" 
Project guided by Chris Dutton to wrap up the Power BI Desktop for Business Intelligence course.

After connecting, shaping and modelling the data, I added DAX measure to create the visualization.

The visualization shows the transactions, profit, and returns filtered by number of transactions (top 30 brands).
Current month transaction, profit and returns in comparison with the previous month. The target for monthly transactions and profit is an increse of 10% each month.
Also, it shows the weekly revenue an the trend over the year 1998.
Product were sold in the USA, Mexico and Canada with the possibility of filtering by country, state or city.
